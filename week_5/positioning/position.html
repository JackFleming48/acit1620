    <h1>Absolute positioning</h1>
    <p>
        I am a basic block level element. My adjacent
        block level elements sit on new lines
        below me.
    </p>

    <p class="positioned">
        By default we span 100% of the width of our
        parent element, and we are as tall as our
        child content. Total width and height is
        contenet + padding + border width/height.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are seperated by our margins. Because of
        margin collapsin, we are separated by the
        width of one of our margins, not both.
    </p>

    <p>
        inline elements <span>like this one</span>
        and <span>this one</span> sit on the same
        line as one anotherm and adjacent text nodes
        if there is no space on the same line.
